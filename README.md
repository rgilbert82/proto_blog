This is a single-page news/blog app that I made with Express, Backbone, Jade, Stylus, Handlebars, jQuery and Underscore. The general look of the app is based on Politico, but I took several creative liberties with the design. I populated the site with Mega Man themed dummy content rather than just ripping the content directly from Politico. I had been revisiting some of the old NES Mega Man games, and I thought it would be fun to do something like that.

The articles are generated dynamically from data that is stored in JSON files on the backend.
